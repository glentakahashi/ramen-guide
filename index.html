  ramen.guide is a ramen reviewing website created by the self-proclaimed ramen critic <a href="http://glentaka.com">Glen Takahashi</a>.
  In his eyes, there are 5 main components which compose a ramen dish: broth, noodles, egg, meat, and toppings.
  He has created his own rating system on these components to help other ramen lovers discover new ramen shops that server their favorite types of ramen.
  Each category follows a 4 point system to rate the quality of each component.
  4 is like a three-star Michelin rating but for ramen. Very few ramen components will score a 4.
  3 means the component is better than average, and you're sure to enjoy it.
  2 is average and most people will find that it is nothing special or out of the ordinary.
  1 means don't bother, and the component is of very low quality and not worth getting.
  Each ramen shop review will feature one or two of the shop's most famous ramen, detailing their styles (tonkatsu vs. shio, thick noodle vs thin, etc.) and rating them based on their categories.
  Glen's personal favorite ramen is Tsujita Annex in LA, which features an extremely heavy tonkatsu broth and thick noodles.
